## 🚀 Getting Started

# 1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/Abhi95081/Cyber_Knightsbridge.git
cd Cyber_Knightsbridge

# 2. Open in Android Studio

Use Android Studio Hedgehog (or newer) for best compatibility.
Allow Kotlin and Compose dependencies to sync.

# 3. Run the app
Use a physical device or emulator with biometric support.
Make sure fingerprint authentication is enrolled.

## 📌 Notes
Fingerprint matching logic can be extended with AI/ML models or external APIs.

For emulators: Use Android 11+ images and enable biometric testing in AVD.

Built as part of a cybersecurity and identity verification showcase project.
